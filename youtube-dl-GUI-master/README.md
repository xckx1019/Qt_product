youtube-dl-GUI
==============

This repository contains code for a youtube-dl GUI written in PyQt. It is based on [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) which is a Video downloading script maintained by various contributers and released in Public Domain. This GUI code is currently written for Python v2.x and not v3.x However I will make it compatible with Python v3.x after refining it a little. Please note that this GUI code is released under the MIT License and not Public Domain.

Requirements:
------------
- PyQt4
- Python >= v2.6
- py2exe - _see Windows_

Features:
----------
This application has the following features:
- supports downloading videos from 200+ websites
- allows to download multiple videos in parallel
- shows download statistics separately for each video
- Resumes interrupted downloads
- Downloads the video in best quality

Windows:
-----------
The exe is currently hosted on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oj8dh4q82tofk34/youtube-dl.exe). I have included a setup.py file. Just run it like this:
```
python setup.py py2exe
```
This will result in a dist and build directory. Simply go to the dist directory and you will get a ```main.exe``` file and some other files. That ```main.exe``` file is a standalone executable which can be run simply by double clicking it. You can distribute that file to your friend.

Note:
-----

I am doing a huge change in the code base and UI so it is very unstable right now. You may use it at your own risk.
Some UI components are not wired up so they are useless right now.
